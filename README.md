this project  takes ECB rates from an API (using a tKinter interface for to and from date picking) and puts them into a data frame before presenting the values in a tkinter graph view
This only works for a currency(any) to Euro conversion. It will not work for Euro to currency(any)
to do this I need to use and other API
